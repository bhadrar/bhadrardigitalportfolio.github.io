    <h1>-Stretches, Strengths, and SMART goals-</h1>

      <h3> My Strength:</h3>
        <ul><li>My strength is that I am good at hands-on and interactive projects. This strength has remained constant but also different in a couple of ways. For example, I still believe that I do well in hands-on and interactive projects, like the map project (which is my history artfact - see the Artifacts page). But I also think my strength has expanded and improved so far over the year, because now I don't only enjoy interactive projects, but also I enjoy participating in and expressing other skills, like analysis (my SMART goal) which I also used in the map project when I annotated it as part of the project.</li></ul>

      <h3> My Stretch:</h3>
      <ul><li>My stretch was that I am almost a perfectionist. This stretch has only remained partially constant this year, which is good. My main issue earlier in the year and in previous years was that I almost never took any pride in my own work unless it was absolutely perfect with no error (which, as I have now realized, is obviously impossible). I would spend a lot of time stressing over little imperfections, which was a detriment to the final product and took away from the overall quality and the joy I experienced from my work. Now I rarely ever waste time like that after realizing that not everything has to be perfect for me to take pride in my hard work and obtain satisfactory results. However, I still strive for perfection (in a good way) in my work by putting in a lot of effort.</li></ul>
      <hr>
      <h3> My SMART Goal:</h3>
      <ul><li>The SMART goal I set in the fall was: I want to write better and more in depth analysis in annotations and essays based on evidence. I have taken steps this year to work toward and achieve my goal. I have worked harder on my annotations and I spend more time on revising my essays. For example, in my Scarlet Letter essay (my literature artifact) I used many direct quotations from the book that I took time to analyze to support my argument. I spend more time to try and include quality analysis and relevant quotations from reliable sources. Overall I think these measures have helped me work toward my goal. I believe that my current plan  has been working quite well to help me achieve my goal. The only thing I would do to modify my plan would be to spend more time planning, revising, and analyzing my essays. In addition, I will work on making connections with past learning outcomes and making interdisciplinary connections.</li></ul>
