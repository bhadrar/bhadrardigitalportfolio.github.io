    <p> Hi! My name is Bhadra Rupesh, and I go to the Rhoades School. I have been attending Rhoades for eight years, and this is my ninth! This year I am in eighth grade. I believe that this year I have grown in many ways as a student and a person.</p>
   
    <p> Welcome to this student-led conference! In this website you will find my school year goals (my strength, stretch, and SMART goal), my artifacts for four subjects (Social Studies, Literature, Spanish, and Math), my mid-year reflection, work I've done in technology, and a description of my extracurricular activities.</p>
