  <h3> Responses:</h3>

        <li> My friend group is quite broad, as there are no cliques or rigid friend groups at school. We are even friends with kids in other  grades! New peers are always accepted in groups as long as they don't hurt the emotional or physical aspect of our group. As eighth graders, we know we should act as role models, so we try to include kids who are in younger grades in our friend groups as much as possible.</li>
        <li>In my middle school years, I have tried my best to create a lasting effect on the Rhoades community. For example, in sixth grade I was in the Girl Rising Club, and every year I have participated in their Open Mic Night fundraiser. Another leadership role I have taken is in the first Rhoades Student Council as Academic Represesntative of 8th Grade. Finally, I also participate in many community service and service learning activities, one of which is volunteering at the Casa de Amistad and helping kids from grades K-2 learn in STEM subjects.</li>
        <li>Overall, I have been consistent with completing work on time. I always turn in my homework and it is never late. I pride myself on time management so if I have a big project due, I try to work on it over a long time and split up the work so nothing is last-minute and I am not stressed.</li>
